    <p id="p2">Snakes and Ladders is an ancient Indian board game regarded today as a worldwide classic.It is played between two or more players on a gameboard having numbered, gridded squares.<br>All tokens begin the game on square #1, Player rolls the die and moves his token the number of spaces indicated on the die.The player to the left of the first player then takes his turn. Game play continues clockwise to each player.<br><br>
    During game play, any player whose token finishes its turn on a square with the bottom of a ladder on it climbs his token up the ladder to the square where the ladder ends. Similarly, any player whose token finishes its turn on a square with a snake's head must slide down the snake to the square where the snake's tail ends. <br><br>
        The first person to finish on square #100 is the winner..! The player must land on square #100 by an exact roll - i.e. must roll a three if their token is on square #97. If the number rolled on the die is higher than the number of squares remaining, the token must be moved forward to #100, and then back again to make up the correct number required. This sometimes means more trouble with the snakes waiting on squares #98 and #95.<br><br></p>
